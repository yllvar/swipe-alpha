# Swipe Alpha: Quantitative Dating Optimization

## Overview

Swipe Alpha is an innovative application that merges quantitative finance methodologies with dating app analytics to optimize match selection and interaction strategies on Tinder. By treating dating decisions as investment decisions, the application applies portfolio theory, options pricing, Monte Carlo simulations, and machine learning to maximize your dating "returns" while managing "risk."


This application represents a novel intersection of quantitative finance and behavioral dating analytics, providing users with sophisticated tools to understand and optimize their romantic decision-making processes.
## Key Features

### 1. Portfolio Optimization for Matches
- **Mean-Variance Optimization**: Applies Markowitz portfolio theory to balance match quality ("returns") and compatibility risk
- **Black-Litterman Model**: Incorporates subjective views about different "types" of matches
- **Efficient Frontier Analysis**: Identifies the optimal mix of matches to maximize your dating Sharpe ratio

### 2. Alpha Signal Detection
- **Machine Learning Classifier**: Identifies profile characteristics that predict successful matches
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Reveals which bio elements, photos, or message styles correlate with success
- **Real-time Prediction**: Scores new profiles based on your historical success patterns

### 3. Behavioral Simulations
- **Monte Carlo Analysis**: Simulates thousands of potential dating scenarios
- **Strategy Backtesting**: Tests how different swiping/messaging approaches would have performed
- **Time-Decay Modeling**: Accounts for the decreasing value of matches over time

### 4. Advanced NLP Analysis
- **Sentiment Scoring**: Analyzes emotional tone of bios and messages
- **Readability Metrics**: Evaluates writing complexity and style
- **Key Phrase Extraction**: Identifies common themes in successful profiles

### 5. Options Pricing Framework
- **Black-Scholes Model**: Treats matches as options contracts with expiration
- **Time Value Calculation**: Determines optimal timing for messaging
- **Delta Hedging**: Adjusts your "dating portfolio" based on changing conditions

## Architecture Components
